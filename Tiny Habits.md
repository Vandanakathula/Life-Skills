# Tiny-Habits

## Tiny Habits — BJ Fogg (TEDxFremont)

### Question 1: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting idea in the video is that big changes start with very small habits. BJ Fogg explains that instead of trying to make huge changes at once, we should start with tiny actions that are easy to do.
For example, doing just two pushups or a very small task daily helps build consistency. Over time, these small habits grow into bigger positive changes.
This idea stood out because it shows that success doesn’t need big motivation, just small consistent steps.

### Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
B = MAP means Behavior happens when **Motivation, Ability, and Prompt** come together.
- **M (Motivation):** Your desire or reason to do the habit.
- **A (Ability):** The habit should be easy to do.
- **P (Prompt):** A reminder or trigger to do the habit.
To make new habits easier, we should make the habit very small and easy, and connect it to something we already do daily so we don’t rely only on motivation.

### Question 3: Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
Celebrating after completing a habit makes us feel successful and motivates us to repeat the habit again. 
Even if the action is very small, celebrating creates positive feelings and builds consistency.
When we celebrate small wins, the habit slowly becomes natural and part of our daily routine.

## 1% Better Every Day — James Clear

### Question 4: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting idea in the video is that **small daily improvements add up to big results over time**. James Clear explains that if you improve just 1% every day, those small gains compound and lead to major progress.
This idea stood out because it shows that success doesn’t need huge changes all at once — it is more about consistent small actions that build up over time.

## Atomic Habits — Book Summary

### Question 5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?
The book explains that real habit change starts with **changing identity**. Instead of focusing only on results, we should focus on becoming the type of person we want to be.
For example, instead of saying “I want to lose weight,” we should think “I am a healthy person,” and then our actions slowly match that identity.

### Question 6: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
To make a habit easier, we should **reduce effort and friction**. Keep things ready and make the habit simple to start.
For example, keeping workout clothes ready or placing a book near the bed makes it easier to follow the habit.

### Question 7: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
To avoid bad habits, we should **increase difficulty and remove triggers**.
For example, keeping junk food out of the house or uninstalling distracting apps makes bad habits harder to continue.

- Practice topics I enjoy to keep it interesting.
- Feel satisfied by tracking daily progress after completing practice.

## Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

Steps:
- Keep the phone away while studying.
